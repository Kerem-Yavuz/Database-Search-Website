I have added nodejs modules so you can just update the DB values to your own DB and use it 



ABOUT DB:  

I have already added "sehirler.sql" you can use this query to create DB and table which has 2 column, also you can use your own database. 
If you are gonna use your own DB make sure to change names of the columns, table and DB  look for /index.js:9,23,43,47
